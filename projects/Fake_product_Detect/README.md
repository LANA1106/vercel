## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the project to your local machine**

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Fake_product_Detect
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install dependencies using the automated installer**:
   ```bash
   python install_dependencies.py
   ```
   
   Or manually install with pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Note**: If you encounter installation errors, the automated installer will handle them gracefully and the application will still work with partial dependencies.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app_simple.py
   ```
   
   Or use the original advanced version (if all dependencies are installed):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **The application will be running** and ready to use!

## Usage

### Analyzing a Product

1. **Fill in the product form**:
   - **Product Name**: Enter the product name/title
   - **Price**: Enter the product price in USD
   - **Website URL**: Paste the product page URL (optional)
   - **Description**: Add product description (optional)
   - **Image**: Upload a product image (optional)

2. **Click "Analyze Product"** to start the analysis

3. **View the results**:
   - Authenticity score (0-100%)
   - Detailed analysis breakdown
   - Specific recommendations
   - Option to report fake products

### Understanding the Analysis

The system evaluates products based on:

- **Price Analysis**: Compares price against known market values
- **Seller Verification**: Checks if the seller/domain is legitimate
- **Description Analysis**: Looks for suspicious keywords
- **URL Analysis**: Examines URL structure for red flags

### Authenticity Scores

- **80-100%**: Likely authentic - proceed with caution
- **60-79%**: Needs further research - verify additional details
- **0-59%**: High risk - avoid purchase

## Customization

### Adding New Brands
Edit the `brand_price_ranges` dictionary in `app.py`:

```python
self.brand_price_ranges = {
    'your_brand': {'min': 50, 'max': 500},
    # ... existing brands
}
```

### Adding Legitimate Sellers
Update the `legitimate_sellers` set in `app.py`:

```python
self.legitimate_sellers = {
    'your-trusted-site.com',
    # ... existing sellers
}
```

### Modifying Suspicious Keywords

self.suspicious_keywords = {
    'your_suspicious_word',
    # ... existing keywords
}
```

## Security Considerations
